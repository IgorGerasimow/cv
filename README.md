### Summary

I'm a python geek and devops.

More than ten years of software engineering and devops practice have provided me with strong skills in high load distributed projects, microservices, monitoring, configuration, deployment, tests and continuous integration.

Diligence and dedication, responsibility, keen interest and desire to solve the problem allow me to work well as a single specialist and as a team player.

### Desired Improvement Areas

- devops
- cloud architect
- technical evangelist

### Skills & Expertise

**Preferred**: linux, golang, kubernetes ( wide range distros), clouds.

- **environment**: baremetal, aws, gce
- **deploy**:    ansible, helm, 
- **monitoring**:    datadog, prometheus+exporters, telegraf, ELK stack and some others.
- **containers**:    docker, docker-compose, kubernetes
- **language ability**:   fluent english, ukr, rus

Key-used technologies and tools: 
 - linux - up 10 years of using, ubuntu/debian preferable.
 - aws ~ 10 years of day-to-day usage vof arious aws servies - eks, ec2, rds, cloudApi, efs and many others.
 - gcp ~ 2-3 years of expirience.
 - kubernetes ( EKS, GKE, kops, kubespray ) ~ 5 years of usage, up-to ~250 nodes in cluster, PR based environmets ( preview or dynamical ), full setup with Terraform and Terragrunt. Of course I used KEDA and Karpenter as scaling solution, aws scaler as well. 
 - terraform - 6 years of daily usage. Prefer to use bese practice - small chnages, PR's, separate state per logical module, documentation is must. Of course I wrote modules, basic and more complex logical - described platform part - auth stack as example: 
 ```
     elastiCashe as storage
     kubernetes app 
     apigateway as endpoint 
     s3 as static storage 
```
 - continuous delivery - 6 years of implementation with Jenkins, gitlab-ci, argoCD, flux, etc. 

Experience included:

- Planning project architectures, environments, CI & CD pipelines, etc;  
- Setup of cloud environments, bare metal servers, operating systems;  
- Improvement of develop and deployment cycles;  
- Consulting for developers teams; 

Configuration and automation of services like:
- cloud native apps principals
- cloud and apps architecture
- delivery processes - gitops as well 
- various web servers topologies
- load balancing with
and many more ;)
